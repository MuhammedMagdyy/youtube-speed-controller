# 🎬 YouTube Speed Controller

> “Time is precious — especially when the tutorial is really taking its time.” – Me, when I hit play at 3x 😄

A lightweight Chrome Extension to **break past YouTube’s speed limit** — because sometimes, even 2x just isn’t fast enough. 🫣

## 💡 Why I Made This?

I was watching a NestJS course and noticed something odd:  
Even at **2x speed**, it felt like I was watching in **slow motion**. 🐢  
So I looked around for a faster option... and when I didn’t find what I needed, I built it myself!

Now, with this extension, you can go **beyond 2x** and take full control of your learning pace. 🚀

## 🚀 What It Does?

- Adds extra speed control buttons to YouTube videos
- Supports speeds beyond YouTube's default max (like 2.5x, and 3x)
- Clean, simple, and effective
